<h2>What is this repo?</h2>

This is the TensorFlow example repo.  It has several classes of material:

* For me to explore neural networks and their applications to Computer Vision.
* Combine my passion for Computer Vision with my interest in Track & Field.
* Build off of existing frameworks so I can better focus on learning about neural networks.
