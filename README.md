<h2>What is this repo?</h2>

This is the TensorFlow example repo.  It has several classes of material:

* For me to explore neural networks and their applications to Computer Vision.
* Combine my passion for Computer Vision with my interest in Track & Field.
* Build off existing frameworks so I can better focus on learning about neural networks.

<h2>Files that I changed from the original forked repo (https://github.com/qadolphe/Running-Form-Analyzer/tree/master/android) </h2>

* PoseClassifier.kt
* Labels.txt
* Build.gradle
* gradle.properties
* AndroidManifest.xml

<h2>Training Classification Neural Network</h2>

* Architecture was built from TensorFlow example documents: https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/tutorials/pose_classification
* I built the training and test data sets from:
