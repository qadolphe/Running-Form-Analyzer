# Build the demo using Android Studio

### Prerequisites

* If you don't have it already, install **[Android Studio](
 https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)** 4.2 or
 above, following the instructions on the website.

* Android device and Android development environment with minimum API 21.

### Building
* Open Android Studio, and from the `Welcome` screen, select
`Open an existing Android Studio project`.

* From the `Open File or Project` window that appears, navigate to and select
 the `lite/examples/pose_estimation/android` directory from wherever you
 cloned the `tensorflow/examples` GitHub repo. Click `OK`.

* If it asks you to do a `Gradle Sync`, click `OK`.

* You may also need to install various platforms and tools, if you get errors
 like `Failed to find target with hash string 'android-21'` and similar. Click
 the `Run` button (the green arrow) or select `Run` > `Run 'android'` from the
 top menu. You may need to rebuild the project using `Build` > `Rebuild Project`.

* If it asks you to use `Instant Run`, click `Proceed Without Instant Run`.

* Also, you need to have an Android device plugged in with developer options
 enabled at this point. See **[here](
 https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device)** for more details
 on setting up developer devices.
